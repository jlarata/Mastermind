A game of logical guessing. This was a challenge in an Algorythm Class Manual i'm reading.
The game will produce a random number with 4 different figures. The player must guess by trying
each time with a 4-digit number. The program return how many "aciertos" (successes) and "coincidencias"
meaning a correct number in the correct position, or a correct number in a wrong position.
When total success is achieved, the program return the amount of attempts.
